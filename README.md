# Vimcord-Tools
A portage of Discord Tools by @Darkempire to nvim

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to add a nvim-discord swiss-knife, with snippets, archs to create bots in various languages and most importantly, documentation and uniformed coding style for it.

The most important part of this is :
- Documentation
- Type Safety, as much as possible.

The project will be written in `VIM-script` *only*, not any other language will be used since it's a nvim plug-in.

## Supported languages

This project aims to support snippets and archs for these languages (the list can evolve) :

Language|Status
--------|------
Python|Not supported

To add a language to the list, you need to create a new branch, open a pull request and *then* you can merge your changes into the plug-in.
